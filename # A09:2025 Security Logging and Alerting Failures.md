# A09: Security Logging and Alerting Failures

## Overview

Security Logging and Alerting Failures occur when applications do not generate sufficient logs or alerts for security-relevant events.

---

## Attack Scenario

An attacker performs malicious actions without triggering alerts or leaving usable audit logs.

---

## Proof of Concept (PoC)

```text
Unauthorized access without logging or alerts
```

---

## Impact

- Delayed incident response
- Undetected breaches
- Compliance violations

---

## Root Cause Analysis

- Insufficient logging
- Lack of monitoring
- No alerting mechanisms

---

## Remediation Strategies

- Log authentication and authorization events
- Implement centralized monitoring
- Configure real-time alerts
