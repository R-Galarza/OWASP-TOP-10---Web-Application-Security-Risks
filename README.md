# OWASP TOP 10 Web Application Security Risks

## Overview

This repository is focused on **hands-on learning** of the OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks.
Each section demonstrates how a vulnerability can be **exploited in a controlled environment** and how it can be **properly remediated** using modern security best practices.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to understand how attackers think and how to defend web applications effectively by combining:

* Minimal theory
* Realistic exploitation scenarios
* Clear and actionable remediation guidance

## Repository Structure

Each OWASP Top 10 vulnerability has its own directory and includes:

* A clear description of the vulnerability
* A vulnerable scenario (lab / controlled example)
* Step-by-step explanation of the exploitation process
* Technical and business impact
* Remediation strategies aligned with OWASP recommendations

Example structure:

```
A01-Broken_Access_Control/
A02-Security Misconfiguration/
A03-Software Supply Chain Failure/
A04-Cryptographic Failures/
...
```

## Project Status

Some sections may be marked as **WIP (Work in Progress)**.
The repository is updated incrementally, focusing on **depth, clarity, and accuracy** rather than speed.

## Disclaimer

All content in this repository is intended **for educational purposes only**.
Testing and exploitation are performed exclusively in controlled environments.
Do not use these techniques against systems without explicit authorization.
