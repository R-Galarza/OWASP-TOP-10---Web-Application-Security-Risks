# A06: Insecure Design

## Overview

Insecure Design refers to fundamental architectural flaws where security controls were never properly considered during application design.

---

## Attack Scenario

An attacker exploits design-level weaknesses that allow abuse of business logic or trust boundaries.

---

## Proof of Concept (PoC)

```text
Security controls missing by design
```

---

## Impact

- Systemic vulnerabilities
- Repeated exploitation paths
- Difficult remediation

---

## Root Cause Analysis

- Lack of threat modeling
- Missing security requirements
- Overreliance on patching

---

## Remediation Strategies

- Perform threat modeling
- Define security requirements early
- Apply secure design patterns
